# bachelor-thesis
This repository contains the code and analysis for my Bachelor thesis in Medical Physics. The project focuses on quantifying tissue growth using time-lapse microscopy and optical flow algorithms (Farneb√§ck &amp; Lucas-Kanade). Heatmaps, divergence fields, and motion vectors are used to visualize and interpret cellular behavior over time.
